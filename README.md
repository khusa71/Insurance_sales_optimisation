# Insurance Funnel Analysis

This project analyzes an insurance marketing funnel to identify key performance indicators, customer segments, and opportunities for optimization.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior through the insurance funnel, starting from initial website visits to policy sign-ups. The goal is to identify areas for improvement to increase conversion rates and marketing efficiency.

## Data Sources

The project uses two main data sources:

1. **funnel_path.csv:** Contains data on user progression through the funnel, including steps taken and timestamps.
2. **users.csv:** Contains demographic and behavioral data about the users, such as age, income, health conditions, and premium choices.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis is structured into five main questions:

1. **Basic Funnel Metrics Analysis:** Calculates overall conversion rates, CPA, revenue, and efficiency across the entire funnel.
2. **Feature Analysis and Segmentation:** Identifies key features associated with conversion and segments users based on these features to understand performance variations.
3. **Hypotheses and Recommendations:** Develops hypotheses about user behavior and formulates recommendations for improving conversion and efficiency.
4. **Marketing Team Recommendations:** Provides specific recommendations for optimizing marketing spend allocation, targeting, and messaging.
5. **Future Analysis Expansions:** Outlines potential areas for further analysis and identifies valuable additional data points for future collection.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into sections corresponding to each analysis question. Each section includes data loading, processing, analysis, visualization, and summary steps.

## Usage

1. **Import necessary libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tabulate.
2. **Load data:** Update the file paths to your data sources.
3. **Run the code:** Execute the code sections sequentially.
4. **Review the results:** The code generates visualizations and summary tables to present the findings.
